# Getting Started with React Timer


This application showcases two things:

1. A react component showing current time and changing color based on divisibility by 3, 5 or 15 .
2. A real time indicator of how long the user has been moving the cursor across the page. The timer increases if the movement is in top50% and decreases if mouse movement is in bottom 50%.
